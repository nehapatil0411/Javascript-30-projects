🎧 Hi everyone!
Introducing my latest project – a Music Player 🎶

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this music player lets users:

▶️ Play their favorite song with a single click
⏸️ Pause the music anytime
📍 Seek to any point in the song by clicking on the progress line
Clean UI, responsive design, and smooth functionality—perfect for beginners and those exploring DOM manipulation and media controls in JavaScript.
Hope you like it! 😊
😊
