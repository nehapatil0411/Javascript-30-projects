🚨 COVID-19 State-wise Tracker 🌍📊 Built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap


I created an interactive, dynamic COVID-19 tracker that displays state-wise data using a public API! 💻🦠 Data is fetched and displayed in a clean table format using JavaScript DOM manipulation, loops, and styled with HTML & CSS & Bootstrap for a clean, responsive design. 💻🌐
This project demonstrates how powerful APIs and core web development concepts can come together to create informative tools. 💪✨

👨‍💻 Tech Used: JavaScript | HTML | CSS | API | Bootstrap
🧠 Concepts Applied: Fetch API | DOM Manipulation | Loops | Dynamic Table |  Responsive Design

✨ Extra Feature: When you hover over any row or column, the background color changes to improve user interaction and readability! 🖱️🎨
