🛠️✨ Project Showcase: COVID-19 India Dashboard ✨🛠️

I’m excited to share a project I recently built — a responsive and dynamic COVID-19 Dashboard focused on real-time, state-wise data of 🇮🇳 India!

🔗 This dashboard fetches live data from the Rootnet COVID-19 API, ensuring users get up-to-date information on active cases, recoveries, deaths, and more for each Indian state.

📋 The data is beautifully displayed in a structured table format, designed with the power of Bootstrap for a clean, professional, and fully responsive UI/UX across all devices.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack:

HTML5 for building the structure 📄

CSS3 for custom styling 🎨

Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and grid system 📱

JavaScript for dynamic data fetching and real-time DOM updates ⚡

Rootnet API for seamless integration of COVID-19 stats 📈

🌟 Key Features:

🔄 Real-time API Integration (No page reloads needed)

📱 Mobile-First Responsive Design

🗂️ State-wise Detailed Statistics

🎨 Polished UI with Bootstrap Components

⚡ Fast and Lightweight Performance

🧹 Clean Code Structure for easy scalability

This project challenged me to work with real-time APIs, manage asynchronous data fetching, and focus on clean, efficient frontend design — a truly rewarding experience! 🌍

I believe having access to timely, accurate information can make a real difference, and this dashboard is a small step toward that goal. 🙌
