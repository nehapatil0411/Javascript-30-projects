Hii everyone! 👋
I’ve made a simple and clean Toast Notification system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 💻
When you click on the buttons — ✅ Success, ❌ Error, or ⚠️ Invalid — a toast notification pops up!
It’s lightweight, easy to use, and made with pure JS. 🙌

Check it out and feel free to give it a ⭐ if you like it!
